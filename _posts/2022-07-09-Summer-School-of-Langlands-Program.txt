# Notes from Summer School of Langlands Program

***Remark:*** These notes only contain material I could comprehend during the summer school conducted from 11th July,2022-30th July 2022. Also, for my understanding, I have added extra definitions and examples.

**Day 1: Shimura varieties**
Original notes shared during lecture can be found [here](https://quatramaran.salle-s.org/~smorel/Shimura%20varieties.pdf).

*Definition (Algebraic Matrix Group):* Let $k$ be an algebraicallly closed field. We denote $M(n,k)$ the group of $n$x$n$ matrices with entries in k and $GL(n,k)$ group of all $n$x$n$ invertible matices. $GL(n,K)$ forms a affine subvariety in $k^{n^2+1}$ given by 
$(g_{11},g_{12},\cdots,g_{nn}) \mapsto (g_{11},g_{12},\cdots,g_{nn}, (det$ g$)^{-1})$
The set $M(n, k)$ carries a topology-the Zariski topology-the closed sets being the algebraic subsets of $M(n, k) = k^{n^2}$.The ring $GL(n, k)$ is an open subset of $M(n, k)$ and carries the induced topology.
Subgroup $G$ of $GL(n,k)$ is called algebraic matrix group if $G$ is closed subset of $GL(n,k)$.
Let $I_k$ denote the ideal of all polynomials with coefficient in $k$ and vanishing on $G$.

Let $G$ be a $k$-group in the sense of above definition. Then for any $k-algebra$ $A$, we may consider the set $G_A$ of elements of $GL(n, A)$ whose coefficients annihilate the polynomials in $I_k.$
