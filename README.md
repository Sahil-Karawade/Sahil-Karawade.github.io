#### <ins> Notes from Papers and Text</ins>
* [Espace etale of a Presheaf](https://sahil-karawade.github.io//folder/Espace%20etale%20of%20a%20Presheaf.pdf)

##### I worked during my MSc to prove the equivalence of categories between categories of affine varieties and categories of finitely generated integral domain over an algebraically closed field. My Masters project can be found [here](https://sahil-karawade.github.io/folder/Sahil%20Karawade(203102010).pdf).
